#### Description 
Trendzy is a multi-social media application where users can see what's trending on all the major social media platforms.     Twitter, Instagram and Facebook separately are all powerful tools to see what's trending in the world. Trendzy combines these platforms into one fully immersive experience. Our application will have two distinct features. The first is a map based UI where users can see posts based on location. The map will default to the users location and indicate spots on the map where there has recent social media activity. The user can then tap on the marker and they will be able to see more details about the posts. The user can search for a location or simply pan the map and pinch to zoom in to it.

#### Vision Statement 
We envision an engaging new medium to browse social media through, resulting in the user being more connected to what is going on around them, rather than what is going on in their isolated circle of friends.

#### Motivation
This app was created in attempt to make engaging in social media on a global scale easier. The process of gathering popular content and making it easier to consume for the users has seen increased popularity recently (Youtube’s “trending” tab, Snapchat’s national/global stories”, etc), so it seems like a natural next step to use this process, but combine it with the various forms of social media we have today, in an easy to use, engaging application.
